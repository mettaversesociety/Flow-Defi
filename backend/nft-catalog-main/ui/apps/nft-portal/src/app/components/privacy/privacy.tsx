        This Privacy Notice applies to you if you visit {url} and use the Flow NFT Catalog application (collectively the “App”).

        <br />
        <b>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b>
        <br />
        We do not collect personal information in connection with the use of the App.
        <br />
        <br />
        Information you provide to us is used to register metadata for a Non-Fungible Token on the Flow™ blockchain network.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>THIRD PARTY LINKS</b>
        <br />
        The App may contain links to other sites. The owners of the linked sites are solely responsible for their privacy practices and content. Dapper is not responsible and does not endorse or control the content and privacy practices of third-party websites. When you access a third-party website, you will be subject to the terms of their applicable privacy policies and recommend you review them carefully.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>COOKIES AND OTHER SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</b>
        <br />
        We do not use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies to collect information about you.
        <br />
        <br />
        Without a common industry or legal standard for interpreting Do Not Track (DNT) signals, we do not respond to browser DNT signals.
        <br />

        <br />
        <b>INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFER</b>
        <br />
        Information collected by Dapper may be transferred, stored, and processed in Canada, the U.S., or in any other country where Dapper or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities, in which case the information may be subject to the laws of that jurisdiction.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>SECURITY</b>
        <br />
        We take reasonable efforts to protect information we collect using appropriate physical, technological and organizational safeguards. No security is foolproof, and the Internet is an insecure medium. However, we work hard to protect you from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, and destruction of your information collected and stored by us. As such, we have policies, procedures, guidelines, and safeguards in place to ensure your information is protected.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>CHILDREN</b>
        <br />
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected personal information for a child under the age of 13, we will delete it, unless we are legally obligated to retain such information. If you are a parent or guardian of a child and you become aware that a child has provided personal information to us, please contact via the methods described in the “How to Contact Us” section below.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        Dapper reserves the right to make changes or update this Privacy Notice from time to time. The revised Privacy Notice will be effective as of the published last updated date. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Notice, we will notify you by email or other means prior to the changes becoming effective, or as otherwise required by law. We will also take other measures, to the extent they are required by applicable law.
